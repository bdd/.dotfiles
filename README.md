Opinions, occasional overkill, or oddly spartan looking things ahead. Buyer beware!

## XDG
In order too keep things tidy under `$HOME`, [XDG Base Directory
Specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/basedir-spec-latest.html) is
followed on all platforms.

You will find configuration files for various applications including shells and editors under
[`dot.config`](dot.config) directory.

A bunch of shell scripts I'd like to have on every machine live under `~/.local/bin` are at
[`dot.local/bin`](dot.local/bin).

## You might be looking for...

* [Zsh](dot.zshrc) and [Bash](dot.bashrc) rc files.

  * ...and [rc extensions](dot.config/shrc). Used by both shells, adding a few helpers
generally as shell functions.

* [Vim](dot.config/vim) configuration. My daily driver.

  * ...or if you're looking for my [essentially colorless
colorscheme](dot.config/vim/colors/noclown.vim).

* _Archived_ [Emacs](dot.config/emacs) configuration. I haven't touched this since early 2017.
